# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

## Context
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. We just need to predict the sorts of people who were lucky enough to survive and those who were not. So, it is an example of classification. 

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and it contains a training set, testing set and sample submission. The total number of columns present in train data is 25 including survival prediction column. Number of rows in train data and test data are 891 and 418 respectively. 

## Implementation Details
- Statistical Analysis using various Visualisations and pandas in built functions
- Feature Engineering operations such as Imputation, Scaling, Encoding etc.
- Trained dataset using Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest Classifier
- Used Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning

### Frameworks
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn 
- Sklearn
